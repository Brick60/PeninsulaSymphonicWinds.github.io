<p align="justify" class="type12"><img src="images/members/adams.jpg" alt="Jerry Adams" width="90" height="90" hspace="7" vspace="7" align="left" />Like many trumpet players, Jerry was inspired as a youngster by Rafael Mendez, the famous virtuoso trumpet player (1906-1981).  In the fifth grade, a Mendez concert and music clinic got him started on what became a life-long love of the horn.  Growing up in a small town in Illinois, he enjoyed a well-supported music program and studied with the school music director who also conducted band concerts in the town square on Saturday evenings.  Those concerts were a regular event in the summertime, echoing a tradition that dates back to the era of Patrick Gilmore and John Philip Sousa &ndash; as does the Peninsula Symphonic Winds today. </p>
<p align="justify" class="type12">After graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1965, Jerry came to California with his new wife, Jeanette, a pianist, for graduate school at UCLA and a job with the Hughes Aircraft Company in the then-new communication  satellite industry.  Throughout his 34-year engineering career, he always found time for music, participating in community bands in Westchester and Palos Verdes and studying trumpet with Claude Gordon.  A favorite destination on business trips to Washington, D.C. was the Marine Band concerts on the Capitol steps. </p>
<p align="justify" class="type12">Jerry played with Richard Schwalbe&rsquo;s Palos Verdes Symphonic Band for 18 years, also taking an active role in the business operations of that band.  He has played with the Peninsula Symphonic Winds since 1999 and is the current President of the Peninsula Symphonic Winds Association, a member of the PSW Brass Sextet, and studies trumpet with Grant Hungerford.  He and Jeanette have two grown daughters and four grandchildren &ndash; with a little luck, some of them will enjoy music for as long and as much as their grandparents have! </p>

Although her parents were not professional musicians, her Dad worked his way through college playing jazz at various night clubs. Her Mom, an accomplished pianist and singer, has served as the accompanist for various community choral groups, sang lead roles with community opera troupes, and served as church organist for many years.
</p>
<p align="justify" class="type12"> It is not surprising then, that at a very young age, one of Karen's favorite pastimes was to stand in front of her parents' stereo console and conduct the orchestra. When asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would respond emphatically, "a conductor." Karen began studying piano in the second grade, but switched to the flute in the fourth grade. Her musical journey continued through high school and has included such highlights as winning second chair in the Tennessee All State Band, being the assistant drum major of her high school marching band (her one opportunity to fulfill her childhood dream of conducting), and joining her high school band at international band festivals in Italy and Spain. </p>
<p align="justify" class="type12">Karen has played with community bands and orchestras since moving to California in 1984. After a 10 year break to raise two daughters through their toddler years, she joined the Palos Verdes Symphonic Winds in the fall of 1999. </p>

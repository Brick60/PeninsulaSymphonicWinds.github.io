      <p align="justify" class="type12">      Jim O'Donnell is a native Southern Californian who grew up in Hollywood. He started playing trombone in elementary school and progressed through the Los Angeles City Schools, reaching the All-City orchestra in high school. His first trombone teacher was a veteran circus band cornet player, which probably accounts for his lifelong love of old-fashioned circus music. Jim played in various concert bands, jazz bands and orchestras while in school, finally becoming a member of the Peter Meremblum Junior Symphony in Hollywood after graduating from college. </p>
      <p>A career in aerospace engineering interrupted his musical avocation for awhile, but he picked up the horn again in the sixties and has been playing rather steadily ever since. He has played with school and community bands in Houston, Texas and Columbus, Ohio and around the South Bay since the 80's. Not surprisingly, his favorite musician was the famous cornet soloist, Herbert L. Clark and his favorite movie is &quot;The Music Man.&quot; In his next life, he wants to play in the orchestra pit for vaudeville shows. </p></td>

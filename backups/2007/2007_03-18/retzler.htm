      <p align="justify" class="type12">      The clarinet was Ed's first instrument. Then, when his small high school's only oboe player graduated, Ed was tapped to be his successor. He played oboe in the school orchestra, concert band, and woodwind quintet. He particularly remembers playing &quot;Lincolnshire Posy&quot; in a performance conducted by Percy Grainger, the renowned Australian composer of music for wind bands. </p>
      <p>At The College of Wooster he played oboe in the symphony orchestra and concert band and, come rain or snow, bass drum in the Fighting Scots marching band. Drafted into the army in 1952, Ed spent 18 months with the Seventh Army Symphony performing goodwill concerts throughout Germany and Austria. Upon his return to the United States, he studied oboe with Harvey McGuire of the Cleveland Orchestra and played oboe and English horn in the Canton (Ohio) Symphony. </p>
      <p>After moving to California and laying aside his horns for twenty-some years to raise a family and build a career, he took up playing the recorder but soon found the repertoire too limiting and began playing oboe again with the Palos Verdes Symphonic Band. Following retirement from UCLA Extension, Ed enrolled as a music student at California State University, Long Beach to take the music courses he never had time for in college. Ed is a charter member of the Peninsula Symphonic Winds, a founding member of the Palos Verdes Chamber Players, and also plays with The East Winds Quintet.</p></td>

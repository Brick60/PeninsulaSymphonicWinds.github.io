Peninsula Symphonic Winds (PSW) was established in 1996 as an independent, nonprofit educational association. The ensemble is composed of community members who are semi-professional or seasoned amateur musicians. Led by our Music Director Dr. Berkeley Price and Associate Director Mr. John Elg, we perform a wide variety of music from the concert band and symphonic repertoire.

The Salvation Armyâ€™s Torrance Chapel, located at 4223 Emerald Street in Torrance, is our concert home.  The facility is acoustically engineered for musical performances and offers comfortable seating for audience members.

The mission of the Peninsula Symphonic Winds is to provide an opportunity for instrumental musicians to maintain and enhance their musical skills, to prepare and perform the traditional and modern concert band repertoire, to offer stimulating concerts to the public, and to provide a venue for composers of new works for concert band.

We gratefully acknowledge the support of Harbor College, which continues to provide the use of its facilities for rehearsals.

We invite you to browse our website to learn more about us, including opportunities for you to support the Peninsula Symphonic Winds. If you are a wind or percussion instrumentalist, come to a practice at Harbor College some Wednesday evening and see what you think.  And if you enjoy fine band music played well, come to a concert! We look forward to meeting you there.

Thank you for visiting our website.

PSW is affiliated with the Association of Concert Bands, a national organization for bands across America.

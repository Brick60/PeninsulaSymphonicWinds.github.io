For more than 150 years, audiences in our country have enjoyed concert band music played in their communities by local residents. The Peninsula Symphonic Winds continues that tradition.   As with any such organization, the PSW is dependent both on local musicians volunteering their time and on the generosity of community members who provide the financial support required to buy music, secure concert venues, hire guest artists, and to cover other necessary expenses. At present, over 80 percent of our financial support comes from PSW musicians and supporters.

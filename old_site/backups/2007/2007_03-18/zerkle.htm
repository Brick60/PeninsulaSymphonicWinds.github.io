      <p align="justify" class="type12">      Mark's first experiences in music came as a toddler when he was known to tap and bang on any available surface or object. The second child of a military family, Mark was born in Germany and spent several years there as a child. His family later resettled in Virginia Beach, VA. Mark began studying percussion at age 12, and continued through junior high school. In high school, Mark continued to study percussion, participated in marching and symphonic band activities, and was elected to the Virginia All State Band as a timpanist during his senior year. </p>
      <p align="justify">Mark's family moved to California after his graduation from high school, and he attended EI Camino College for two years. While at El Camino, he began studying to pursue a career in business and was a member of the El Camino Symphonic Band, under the direction of Dr. Kenny Caldwell. </p>
      <p align="justify">After an extended absence from organized music, Mark became a member of the Peninsula Symphonic Winds in 1999. He names Lennon/McCartney, Clifton Williams and Henry Mancini among his favorite composers, with Ringo Starr, Neil Peart (Rush) and Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater) among his greatest drumming influences. Mark particularly enjoys playing progressive rock music. He describes his experience in learning to play The Flight of tlw Bumble Bee as &quot;like parenting-fun and scary at the same time&quot;. </p></td>

      <p class="type12"><strong>ABOUT THE MUSIC DIRECTOR </strong></p>
    <p align="justify" class="type12"> Richard Babcock was born in 1956 in Binghamton, New York, the first child of an Anny doctor and his wife. In 1962 the family settled in Salt Lake City, Utah, where Richard spent the next twenty years. At the age of ten, he began the study of the trumpet. This was Richard's first close contact with music and the beginning of his lifelong vocation. He began to compose in junior high and won several local competitions over the next ten years. Along with composing, he began conducting his own works and filling in the missing parts on whatever instrument was needed. After high school, Richard studied at the University of Utah, where as a performer he specialized in woodwinds. He graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor of Music degree, with emphasis in jazz theory and secondary education. Richard spent the next three years teaching music and working as a freelance musician in Salt Lake City. In 1983 he was accepted into the MFA program in composition at California Institute of the Arts. He graduated in 1986, and in 1987 was appointed Director of Orchestras for Chadwick School in Palos Verdes, in which position he continues to serve. From 1985 to 1990 he was the conductor of another fine community band in the Santa Clarita Valley. Richard's experience as conductor, composer and teacher has made him eager to try new things, to take musical risks. </p></td>

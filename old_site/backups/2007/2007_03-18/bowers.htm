      <p align="justify" class="type12">      &quot;My problem&quot;, says Hal Bowers, &quot;is that I enjoy everything&quot;. In addition to building fine furniture, fishing for salmon in Alaska, traveling to places like India or Bhutan, camping in Death Valley, and creating DVDs of his travels, Hal still finds time for music because &quot;it's the most important&quot;. </p>
      <p align="justify">He began piano lessons at the age of four, dabbled briefly with the violin, was chapel organist at MIT during his undergraduate days, studied conducting, and became proficient in percussion. After earning his PhD in Physics from Cornell he played percussion in the Syracuse Community Orchestra, but decided that he really wanted to play chamber music. Bassoonists are always in demand, so he found a teacher and started taking lessons. This versatility is all the more notable for his having dealt with cerebral palsy as a child. After moving to California in 1969, Hal joined the Peninsula Symphony as a bassoonist and has been playing there ever since, as well as with the Peninsula Symphonic Winds and several chamber ensembles.</p></td>

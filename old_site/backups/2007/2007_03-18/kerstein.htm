      <p align="justify" class="type12">      Bob is a self-taught euphonium player who has been with the Peninsula Symphonic Winds since November 1996. Prior to that, Bob played with the Palos Verdes Symphonic Band for 16 years. He also plays in the UCLA Alumni Band. </p>
      <p align="justify">Bob majored in music theory and composition at UCLA in the mid 1960's, where he also played oboe (until he was invited to find another instrument by the resident oboe professor who felt he wasn't being passionate enough about his oboe studies). After taking a brass survey class at UCLA, Bob switched to baritone horn. He played in the UCLA student band for two seasons before joining the Air Force in 1966, where he played in a 12-piece band at Lackland Air Force Base.</p></td>

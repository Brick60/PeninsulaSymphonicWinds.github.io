      <p align="justify" class="type12">        Karen grew up in a family where music, both classical and jazz, was a part of life. 
      Although her parents were not professional musicians, her Dad worked his way through college playing jazz at various night clubs. Her Mom, an accomplished pianist and singer, has served as the accompanist for various community choral groups, sang lead roles with community opera troupes, and served as church organist for many years. </p>
      <p>It is not surprising then, that at a very young age, one of Karen's favorite pastimes was to stand in front of her parents' stereo console and conduct the orchestra. When asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would respond emphatically, &quot;a conductor.&quot; Karen began studying piano in the second grade, but switched to the flute in the fourth grade. Her musical journey continued through high school and has included such highlights as winning second chair in the Tennessee All State Band, being the assistant drum major of her high school marching band (her one opportunity to fulfill her childhood dream of conducting), and joining her high school band at international band festivals in Italy and Spain. </p>
      <p>Karen has played with community bands and orchestras since moving to California in 1984. After a 10 year break to raise two daughters through their toddler years, she joined the Palos Verdes Symphonic Winds in the fall of 1999. </p></td>

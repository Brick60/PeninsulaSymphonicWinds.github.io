      <p align="justify" class="type12">      Music has always been an entirely pleasurable experience for Karin, who was born and raised in San Francisco. She began studying the piano at age seven and the violin in elementary school. Inspired to participate in her high school music program, she played violin in the orchestra. Karin began teaching piano, and had 22 students, aged 4 to 74, by her second year in college. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, where she also won the concerto competition playing Liszt's Piano Concerto #2. She has performed on television for the Miss California/Miss America pageant, initially as a contestant (as Miss San Francisco), and later as a guest performer, playing excerpts from Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. Karin currently owns and manages a medical service organization and participates in her childrens' school music program as an accompanist and performer with the Chadwick Jazz Chamber Ensemble.</p>

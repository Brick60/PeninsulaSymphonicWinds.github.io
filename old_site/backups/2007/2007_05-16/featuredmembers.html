              Babcock was born in 1956 in Binghamton, New York, the first child
              of an Army doctor and his wife. In 1962 the family settled in Salt
              Lake City, Utah, where Richard spent the next twenty years. At
              the age of ten, he began the study of the trumpet. This was Richard's
              first close contact with music and the beginning of his lifelong
              vocation. He began to compose in junior high and won several
              local competitions over the next ten years. Along with composing,
              he began conducting his own works and filling in the missing
              parts on whatever instrument was needed. After high school,
              Richard studied at the University of Utah, where as a performer
              he specialized in woodwinds. He graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor
              of Music degree, with emphasis in jazz theory and secondary
              education. Richard spent the next three years teaching music
              and working as a freelance musician in Salt Lake City. In 1983
              he was accepted into the MFA program in composition at California
              Institute of the Arts. He graduated in 1986, and in 1987 was
              appointed Director of Orchestras for Chadwick School in Palos
              Verdes, in which position he continues to serve. From 1985
              to 1990 he was the conductor of another fine community band
              in the Santa Clarita Valley. Richard's experience as conductor,
              composer and teacher has made him eager to try new things,
              to take musical risks. </p>

              San Francisco. She began studying the piano at age seven and
              the violin in elementary school. Inspired to participate in
              her high school music program, she played violin in the orchestra.
              Karin began teaching piano, and had 22 students, aged 4 to
              74, by her second year in college. She earned bachelor's and
              master's degrees in music from the San Francisco Conservatory
              of Music, where she also won the concerto competition playing
              Liszt's Piano Concerto #2. She has performed on television
              for the Miss California/Miss America pageant, initially as
              a contestant (as Miss San Francisco), and later as a guest
              performer, playing excerpts from Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.
              Karin currently owns and manages a medical service organization
              and participates in her childrens' school music program as

              10 years to raise a family, but could not stay away, so she
              joined the Palos Verdes Symphonic Band and the El Camino College

            months with the Seventh Army Symphony performing goodwill concerts
            throughout Germany and Austria. Upon his return to the United States,
            he studied oboe with Harvey McGuire of the Cleveland Orchestra
            and played oboe and English horn in the Canton (Ohio) Symphony. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="type12">After moving to California and laying aside his horns for twenty-some
            years to raise a family and build a career, he took up playing
            the recorder but soon found the repertoire too limiting and began
            playing oboe again with the Palos Verdes Symphonic Band. Following
            retirement from UCLA Extension, Ed enrolled as a music student
            at California State University, Long Beach to take the music courses
            he never had time for in college. Ed is a charter member of the
            Peninsula Symphonic Winds, a founding member of the Palos Verdes
            Chamber Players, and also plays with The East Winds Quintet. </p>

              music, both classical and jazz, was a part of life. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="type12"> Although her parents were not
            professional musicians, her Dad worked his way through college
            playing jazz at various night clubs. Her Mom, an accomplished
            pianist and singer, has served as the accompanist for various
            community choral groups, sang lead roles with community opera
            troupes, and served as church organist for many years. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="type12">It
            is not surprising then, that at a very young age, one of Karen's
            favorite pastimes was to stand in front of her parents' stereo
            console and conduct the orchestra. When asked what she wanted
            to be when she grew up, she would respond emphatically, &quot;a conductor.&quot; Karen
            began studying piano in the second grade, but switched to the flute
            in the fourth grade. Her musical journey continued through high
            school and has included such highlights as winning second chair
            in the Tennessee All State Band, being the assistant drum major
            of her high school marching band (her one opportunity to fulfill
            her childhood dream of conducting), and joining her high school
            band at international band festivals in Italy and Spain. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="type12">Karen has played with community bands and orchestras since moving
            to California in 1984. After a 10 year break to raise two daughters
            through their toddler years, she joined the Palos Verdes Symphonic
            Winds in the fall of 1999. </p>

              came as a toddler when he was known to tap and bang on any
              available surface or object. The second child of a military
              family, Mark was born in Germany and spent several years there
              as a child. His family later resettled in Virginia Beach, VA.
              Mark began studying percussion at age 12, and continued through
              junior high school. In high school, Mark continued to study percussion,
              participated in marching and symphonic band activities, and was
              elected to the Virginia All State Band as a timpanist during
              his senior year. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="type12">Mark's family moved to California after his graduation from high
            school, and he attended EI Camino College for two years. While
            at El Camino, he began studying to pursue a career in business
            and was a member of the El Camino Symphonic Band, under the direction
            of Dr. Kenny Caldwell. </p>
          <p align="justify"><span class="type12">After an extended absence from organized
            music, Mark became a member of the Peninsula Symphonic Winds
            in 1999. He names Lennon/McCartney, Clifton Williams and Henry
            Mancini among his favorite composers, with Ringo Starr, Neil
            Peart (Rush) and Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater) among his greatest
            drumming influences. Mark particularly enjoys playing progressive
            rock music. He describes his experience in learning to play The
            Flight of the Bumble Bee as &quot;like parenting-fun
            and scary at the same time&quot;. </span></p>
